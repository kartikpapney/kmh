		<dt>SPORTS</dt>
		  <dd>
		  In it&#8217;s very first year of inception, Kanchenjungha Men&#8217;s Hostel has left an indelible impression in the sporting arena of Tezpur University. The year began with the intake of a large number of freshers, who have turned out to be talented, hardworking and promising. We, the boarders of the hostel could sense the beginning of a new era in the sports scene at TU, and as the year proceeded, it did turn out to be so. KMH continued to rock the sports scene this year as it maintained its overall 1st position in sports at TU. There were plenty of moments to savor along with a few disappointments but the overall enthusiasm was unmatched. It all began with a superb victory in outdoor sports, in which we dominated both the track and field events. We participated in the March Past event this year. Students got many medals in running, chess, body building etc. With the kind of talent that we have, we are sure that the number of medals will only grow next year.
